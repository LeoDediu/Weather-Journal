# General
Weather Journal is an asynchronous web application which uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI.

## Overview
Enter your zipcode and some extra data about you in the form.
The zipcode is used to fetch data from the OpenWeather API, the data returned from the API is then in turn submitted to the server along with the user entered data.
The saved data is returned from the server and rendered to the UI.

The goal of this project is practice with:
- Node JS
- Express
- Client-Server communication
- Using APIs and creating requests to external urls

## Getting Started
Run yarn start or npm run start to start the app. Otherwise run node server.js from your console.
